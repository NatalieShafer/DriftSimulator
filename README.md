# DriftSimulator

The objective of this project is to create an application which calculates and displays the most probable positions of an object adrift at sea within the Gulf Stream area.
This is accomplished through using ocean current and weather data to calculate the influence it has on the object. 
Then the application graphically displays the area where the object may drift as time progresses. 

The Ocean and Wind Data used in the project is from Noaa.
